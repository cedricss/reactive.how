`fromEvent` is a function that accepts a source of events, such as _click events_ on a toggle. As a result, it creates **a sequence of events over time**. This sequence is called a **stream**.

Reactive programming is programming with **streams**. 

Reactive stream libraries like RxJS let you:

- **create** a stream from various sources
- **transform** and **filter** a stream in different ways
- **combine** multiple streams
- and more!
