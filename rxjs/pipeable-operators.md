Today, I will use RxJS pipeable operators and create a custom and reusable operator. This is based on the demo I made in [Episode 27](/pipeline-operator).

## Part 1 - Reminder: stream, reactivity and immutability

New to Reactive Programming? Start with [Episode 1](/fromEvent). Here is a summary.

A **stream** is a sequence of events over time (eg. a stream of [_click events_](/fromEvent)). In this episode, I'll use `❚ interval` to create a stream that emits [incremental numbers](/interval), periodically.

A [listener](/listen) reacts to events emitted by a stream (values, error and [completion notification](/take)). This is the **reactivity** principle. I'll use `console.log` as a listener to react to the emitted values.

**Operators** transform, filter and combine streams. An operator never modifies the input stream. Instead, it returns a new stream. This is the **immutability** principle. To create a "gaussian" stream from _interval_ I need:

* the mapping operator `❚ map`. It [projects each event](/map) of the input stream with a project function.
* the filtering operator `❚ take` to set a [maximum _amount_](/take) of events to emit. Indeed, _interval_ emits an infinite number of events, but I want to print only 25 lines on the console.

## Part 2 - Implementation with RxJS pipeable operators

This example is based on RxJS **v6.0** and pipeable operators. Download other versions with my [explorer](http://reactive.how/rxjs/explorer):

> [![](/img/rxjs/explorer/content_preview.jpg){:.w500}](/rxjs/explorer)<br/>[RxJS Explorer 2.0](/rxjs/explorer)

Import the creation function `❚ interval` and the pipeable operators `❚ map` and `❚ take`:

```
import { interval } from "rxjs";
import { map, take } from "rxjs/operators";
```

> ![](/img/rxjs/pipeable-operators/interval-map-draw.gif)

The creation function `❚ interval` returns an `Observable`. It has a built-in `pipe` method to chain pipeable operators.

Emit incremental numbers and complete immediately after the 25th value:

```
const stream1 = interval(350).pipe(
    take(25)
);
```

Emit values projected with a gaussian function, every 350ms:

```
const stream2 = interval(350).pipe(
    take(25),
    map(gaussian)
);
```

Emit lines of "•" based on decimals:

```
const stream3 = interval(350).pipe(
    take(25),
    map(gaussian),
    map(num => "•".repeat(Math.floor(num * 65)))
);
```

Use the `subscribe` method to pass a stream listener:

```
stream.subscribe(console.log)
```

## Part 3 - Creation of a reusable and custom operator

What if I want both a gaussian stream of `•` **and** a bezier stream of `~`?

```
const gaussian_stream = interval(350).pipe(
    take(25),
    map(gaussian),
    map(num => "•".repeat(Math.floor(num * 65)))
);

const bezier_stream = interval(350).pipe(
    take(25),
    map(bezier),
    map(num => "~".repeat(Math.floor(num * 65)))
);
```

Clearly, this code could be refactored. For that, I need to create my own operator, ideally based both on `take(25)` and `map(num => ...)`.

Previously, those two RxJS operators were chained with the **pipe method** built into `Observable`. But here, I want to chain two operators in a separate function.

To do so, RxJS provides a utility pipe function, that needs to be imported:

```
import { interval, pipe } from "rxjs";
import { map, take } from "rxjs/operators";
```

I use this **pipe function** to chain _map_ and _take_. Et voilà! My custom `draw` operator:

```
const draw = brush =>
  pipe(
    map(num => brush.repeat(Math.floor(num * 65))),
    take(25)
  );
```

Finally, my home-made `draw` operator can be used like any other RxJS pipeable operators:

```
const gaussian_stream = interval(350).pipe(
  map(gaussian),
  draw("•")
);

const bezier_stream = interval(350).pipe(
  map(bezier),
  draw("~")
);
```

## Summary

* Import _pipeable operators_ from `rxjs/operators`
* Chain them with the **pipe method** built into `Observable`
* Optionally, import the **pipe function** to build custom and reusable operators from other pipeable operators
